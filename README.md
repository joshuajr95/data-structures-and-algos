# data-structures-and-algos

This repository is to store my code as I write code while following along in the MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms Course. It is a standard data structures and algorithms course that covers everything from sorting to trees, hash tables, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming.

The different algorithms and data structures are sorted by type, although some may overlap (such as heaps with heapsort and BSTs and BST sort).
